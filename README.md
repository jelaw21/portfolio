## Widgets and Gidgets Scripts (C# / Unity)

### [Script Source Gode](https://github.com/jelaw21/Widgets-And-Gidgets)

Demonstrates use of a many different managers which execute different aspects of the game. One of the highlights is a GlobalData manager which controls and processes data used in many of the different classes and functions throughout the game.

### [Tymeria: The Plaguelands Source Code](https://github.com/jelaw21/Tymeria-Source-Code)

I'm very proud of the use of O.O.P used in this small game. The `objects` folder contains lists of items, enemies, players and abilities complete with attributes and local fields. The GUI classes are contained in the `scenes` folder which simply makes calls back to `player` and `enemy` objects, which pull their data from the lists in `objects`. This game can be expanded easily by adding scenes and adding more items and abilities to the lists in objects. To help with the graphical component, the Phaser 3 Javascript framework is used. 

## Java Object Oriented Projects

### [Pong](https://github.com/jelaw21/Pong/tree/master/src)

Demonstrates the use of objects, a `Paddle` and a `Ball`, being used on a `Board`. The same paddle class is used to create both the player and AI paddle. 

### [Shapes Extreme](https://github.com/jelaw21/ShapesExtreme/tree/master/src)

Demostrates the use of inheritance and interfaces. A simple `Sprite` class uses a `paint` and `move` interface. It then uses that `Sprite` class to create multiple classes `Enemies`, `Friendlies` and `Bullets`.
